The Sustainable Fashion Brands Filter is an application where users can select what kind of fashion brand that they're looking for. Whether it be affordable, for modest clothing, one owned by a minority, etc. they can use the dropdown menu in order to input/select what they want. After clicking the button, a list will generate sustainable fashion clothing brands that are under the category that they would want. This app will hopefully promote users to pursue more sustainable clothing options, being that there's a large variety, and also given the fact that the list generated is all sustainable.
